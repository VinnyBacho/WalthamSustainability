            <h2>Waltham is Designated as a "Green Community"</h2>
            <p>Waltham has joined the list of 25 communities that have been designated as part of the "Green Community" program by the Department of Energy Resources. Along with this designation, the city of Waltham has been awarded a grant of $281,080 to be used in further improving Waltham's environment by implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. In order to be considered for the Green Community Designation grant, a municipality has to meet <a href = "https://www.mass.gov/guides/becoming-a-designated-green-community">five specified criteria</a> and submit a project application proposing how these funds will be spent.</p>

            <h2>YEEP</h2>
            <p>The Youth Environment Entrepreneurship Program (YEEP) is an experimental environmental enrichment program geared towards high school and college youths to engage and empower them to act positively for both the environment and themselves by building a service business that provides organic landscaping that provides native plants to the inhabitants of the city of Waltham. This innovative program works to restore vital biodiversity (essential to all life on this planet) and wildlife habitat in our community where development has far outpaced preservation of open space.</p>
